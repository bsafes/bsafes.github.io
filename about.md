BSafes was born when two tech professionals realized that they didnâ€™t have a truly safe place to store and share their notes, proprietary ideas, and private information.

Mr. Shih-Chin Yang and Ms. Hsiao-Wen Lin had been using popular solutions like Email, Skype, Google and Fiverr to communicate and share files with each other and their customers and collaborators.

But, having worked as programmers in Silicon Valley for companies including 3Com and Lockheed Martin, they were fully aware of the risk that many solutions posed to their important data.
                    
They founded their own company, Wu-Nan technology, and created BSafes to use internally to protect their own projects and information.

Realizing the value it could offer professionals and individuals around the world, they made BSafes an client-side open-source encryption solution, available by subscription, in 2019.

The programmers of Wu-Nan technology hope you get as much value and peace of mind from BSafes as they do!
